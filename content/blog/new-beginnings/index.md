# FeathersJs First Impression

Last day I came across, feathersjs which claims to speed up development exponentially. I spent a while setting up the application. The core idea is that we write services, which are can be automagically connected to create restend-points / socketio / primusjs or all three.

After spending a while on the project, I started feeling that feathersjs is an opinionated framework just like django where a lot of decisions are already made for us. 

I will be writing more about my experiments in the coming days ( if I continue working on the project. )

You can read more about the project here.
